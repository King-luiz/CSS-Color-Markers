# CSS Color Markers Project

This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create a set of visually styled markers with distinct colors and gradients. Each marker is represented by two components: a cap and a sleeve, styled using modern CSS techniques such as gradients, shadows, and flexible layout properties.

## Features

- **Three Colored Markers:**
  - **Red Marker** with a gradient transitioning through shades of red and brown, giving it a realistic feel.
  - **Green Marker** with gradients and shadows to mimic a vibrant, fresh design.
  - **Blue Marker** with cool tones and highlights for a sleek appearance.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The markers are centered within a flexible container and adjust neatly to screen sizes due to the use of `margin` and `padding`.

- **CSS Effects:**
  - Linear gradients create smooth color transitions.
  - Box shadows add depth to the markers for a more polished look.

## Project Structure

```
project-folder/
├── ColorMaker.html       # The main HTML file that contains the structure of the page.
└──ColorMaker.css       # The CSS file defining the styles for the markers and layout.

```

## File Descriptions

### `ColorMaker.html`
The main HTML file contains:
- A title (`<h1>` element) to describe the project.
- A container (`<div class="container">`) housing the three markers.
- Each marker is a combination of `cap` and `sleeve` elements within `div` tags, with distinct classes (`red`, `green`, `blue`).

### `ColorMaker.css`
The CSS file provides:
- Layout styling for the container and markers.
- Gradients for different marker colors.
- Shadow effects for added depth.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the `ColorMaker.html` file in any web browser to view the project.

## Customization
- Add more markers by duplicating the existing `marker` div and changing its class.
- Modify colors, gradients, or shadows in the `styles.css` file.
